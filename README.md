# GitAndHubWorkshop

Students on Windows should install [git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). This will also give you a new terminal with a `bash` shell (in addition to windows `command.com`), which is the standard command line shell on unix like systems. 

Mac users have git pre-installed. If you are a linux user, we'll assume you know what you are doing and have installed git.

On all OS's open a terminal with bash/zsh running. On OSX this is `Terminal.app`, on linux `New Terminal`, and on windows `git-bash` terminal.
